As part of our MGPN activities, we are applying for the American Board of Genetic Counseling funding to do a study to:

1)  Describe culturally incompetent, racist, or biased experiences minority genetic counselors faced during their course of training and/or board examination process.

2)  Use the study findings to develop recommendations that support culturally competent and non-biased measures for training programs and the American Board of Genetic Counseling.

Study methodology will include a survey and key informant interviews.  The study findings will be used to make recommendations to support Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion measures for the genetic counseling profession.

We are seeking your support for our application for the ABGC funding using a new idea, which is like crowdsourcing support for the study.  It is not binding that you will participate in the study.

If you want to show your support for the study, please “sign” your support letter by going to:
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/K9R2R9Y

Please sign your support by Monday, August 31st, 7p Eastern/4p Pacific.  We hope that you will support this important project.

If you have questions, please contact Sylvia Mann at sylvia@hawaiigenetics.org.

Hey @everyone, we’ve got an exciting event to share (announcement credit: @Austin)

We are excited to share the news that on October 15, 2020 the Western States Regional Genetics network (www.westernstategenetics.org) will be hosting a Genetic Counseling Virtual Career Fair! 
 
This career fair will provide an opportunity for students and individuals of all ages to connect with over 50 Master’s Level genetic counseling training programs across the continent. Virtual rooms hosted by national organizations including the National Society of Genetic Counselors and Association of Genetic Counseling Program Directors will allow participants to learn more about this exciting and rewarding healthcare profession.
 
The fair will also feature the Minority Genetic Professionals Network (www.minoritygenetics.org), for prospective students to connect with a room of current genetic counseling students and practicing genetic counselors of minority backgrounds.

Are you a CURRENT or PROSPECTIVE genetic counseling student who had a low undergraduate GPA? 

My name is Hannah and I am a prospective genetic counseling student residing in the PNW and I would love to get some feedback if you fit the above criteria! This is an informal, anonymous survey to better understand the role of undergraduate GPA in predicting success in genetic counseling graduate programs and in the workplace. I hope to include your feedback in a GC Journal Club that is scheduled on 10/21! I will be presenting to fellow genetic counselors, prospective and current genetic counseling students, and genetic counseling program directors. I hope my presentation can persuade the audience to consider applicants with a broad range of undergraduate GPAs. It would be very helpful for me and the future of the genetic counseling field if you could complete this survey and share your experience as a current student or prospective student! Please reach out to me if you have any questions!

Thanks in advanced for your time and help!

Hey @CGC @Alumni @LGC (can't figure out how to tag the @GC role)! (Also if you are an @GCA working with relevant GCs) 

I am a second-year student at Columbia, and for my scholarly project, I am studying the guidelines and protocols regarding prenatal diagnostic testing for adult-onset neurodegenerative disease across various institutions in the United States. I have created a survey for healthcare practitioners who may be involved in such processes, including but not limited to prenatal and neurogenetic counselors, OB-GYN/MFM physicians, and neurologists. The data collected from the survey may aid in the development of professional guidelines for PND in the setting of adult-onset neurodegenerative disease.

The link is here: https://cumc.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2b1GH3XQ21pf0ix. This online survey should take no more than 15 minutes to complete, and participation is voluntary. I would greatly appreciate your participation and/or distribution to relevant personnel at your institution - the wider a range of opinions we receive, the better. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns! - @mayapapaya

From @DexMix (UC Irvine) 

I applied to six genetic counseling graduate programs and it cost me almost $5000! How about you?
Applying to graduate school is a costly undertaking. The cost of the application process can add up quickly and become prohibitively expensive for many applicants, especially for prospective students from marginalized or disadvantaged backgrounds. Researchers from UC Irvine want to better understand the financial barriers that applicants experience when they apply to genetic counseling (GC) programs. If you have applied to at least one GC graduate program in the U.S. for admission in Fall 2005 - Fall 2020, regardless of the outcome of your application(s), we want to hear from you! Your participation in this study can help us better understand the financial obstacles and uncover inequities in the application process. The study involves an anonymous online survey that will take about 15 to 20 minutes. 
 
Participants may enter a raffle for one of 100 Starbucks gift cards ($5 each) at the end of the survey.
 
To learn more about the study, please see the attached flyer or visit https://uci.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5u1pu7EKb6dVKxT. If you have any questions, contact the Lead Researcher, Dexter Lee, at dexterl2@hs.uci.edu.

@everyone from @DexMix (UC Irvine): 

I applied to six genetic counseling graduate programs and it cost me almost $5000! How about you?
 
Thank you for those who have participated in the survey to help us better understand the financial barriers that applicants face when they apply to GC programs. If you have not done so yet and are someone who applied to at least one GC graduate program in the U.S. for admission in Fall 2005* - Fall 2020*, we want to hear from you! Didn't interview or receive an admission offer/match? Your input matters too! Your participation in this study can help us better understand the financial obstacles and uncover inequities in the application process. 
 
The study involves an anonymous online survey that will take about 15 to 20 minutes. 
 
Participants may enter a raffle for one of 100 Starbucks gift cards ($5 each) at the end of the survey.
 
To learn more about the study, please see the attached flyer or visit https://uci.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5u1pu7EKb6dVKxT. 
 
 If you have any questions, contact the Lead Researcher, Dexter Lee, at dexterl2@hs.uci.edu, or the faculty sponsor, Kathryn Singh, at kesingh@hs.uci.edu.
 
Get involved and let your experience be heard! Survey will close on 3/31/2021.
 
*Fall 20XX denotes the academic term for which you applied to BEGIN the program if admitted/matched, NOT the year in which you submitted the applications materials.”

Please read below for an opportunity to participate in a study about genetic counseling student communication and assessment. The investigator is looking to enroll about 10 genetic counseling students in the pilot phase of the study. The study will be opened to all eligible students shortly after the pilot phase is complete and students will have the opportunity to be added to the waitlist if we exceed the initial quota.
Study description:
First and second year genetic counseling students are invited to participate in a research study about student communication during genetic counseling sessions. Students who are 18 years or older and who are currently enrolled in an accredited genetic counseling training program in the United States or Canada are eligible to participate.

The study aims to describe genetic counseling student communication, evaluate a communication training intervention, and compare multiple methods of assessing student communication. Participants will be asked to:
Complete baseline surveys on their demographic, personal, and educational characteristics,
Conduct three online genetic counseling standardized patient encounters (realistic cases with a trained actor in the role of client/patient) that will be video recorded,
Complete a brief, self-paced, online training in patient-centered communication skills, and
Complete post-session surveys about communication during the session.
All study activities will take place online. The total time commitment is expected to take approximately 7 hours, over a period of about 10 weeks. Participants will be offered up to $100 in compensation for study participation. Participants may also request access to their session videos and quantitative feedback on session communication after the study has ended.

Those interested in participating can access the eligibility screener and baseline survey at http://jhsph.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_78MCDSHoTbOnrIp. The baseline survey is expected to take approximately 30 minutes to complete. After completing the survey, eligible participants will be directed to schedule an online standardized genetic counseling session.
 
This study is being conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The Principal Investigator is Dr. Debra Roter. Please contact the project director, Chenery Lowe, at clowe7@jhu.edu with any questions about the study.

YWIB Seattle is hoping to host a virtual career panel focused on Genetic Counseling this Autumn, 2021 (tentative date late October-November of 2021). This will be a virtual webinar with around 4 panelists from the field of genetic counseling. Panelists will share their experience as a GC including their path toward the career and answer questions from students. The audience will be students in high school or older. 

The goal is to bring together a diverse group of genetic counselors from different backgrounds to expose students to this field and the opportunities it holds. 

Due to the virtual format, students and panelists from all over the country can participate! This event will also be recorded and posted on the YWIB YouTube channel.

From @Shivster : Here is a flyer regarding my research. I'm a pre-GC student completing my undergraduate research thesis. My research relates to telemedicine uptake and how people have used telemedicine before and since COVID-19 (very relevant to genetic counseling). I've already been contacted by MGPN to share. The questions will have an overall focus on some personal demographics (but names will not be taken), health insurance/education status, people's access to the Internet, if people have utilized telemedicine before and since the pandemic, and beliefs surrounding telemedicine. It should take, at most, 15 minutes. So far the longest survey has been 13 minutes. Feel free to ask me any more clarifiers! I personally recommend taking the survey on a tablet or computer. The link to my survey is https://unlv.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_e5QTpO8lTYNzcSa or you can just scan the QR code on the flyer itself. Anyone can participate so long as they live in the United States and are above the age of 18. It does not matter whether they have utilized telemedicine or not.

You are eligible to participate if you: (1) are a board-certified or board-eligible genetic counselor, (2) have provided clinical genetic counseling to a child or adolescent in the last five years, and (3) can read, speak, and write English. The survey is expected to take approximately 20-25 minutes. You will receive a $40 Amazon gift card for your participation.

From @maia (BU)Are you applying to genetic counseling programs for the class of 2024 or 2025? We would love to hear from you! Genetic counseling programs often look for shadowing, crisis counseling, and advocacy work on applications. These experiences can be barriers to the field, especially with lack of access to practicing genetic counselors. This is a 15 minute anonymous, online, research survey that asks about your experiences while applying to genetic counseling graduate programs. The goal of this research study is to gather information about accessibility of genetic counseling related experiences and how it impacts decision making during the application cycle. At the end of the survey, there is an option to enter your email to be entered into a lottery to win 1 of 4 $25 Amazon gift cards. Link to the survey:

From @SDivs_17:

Good afternoon,

This is an invitation to participate in a research study titled “Genetic Counseling Assistant Study: How clinic workflow and career goals are impacted” being conducted by Sarah Linn, a graduate student in the Bay Path University Genetic Counseling Program.  If you have already completed this survey please do not do the survey again. 
 
The purpose of this mixed-methods study is to assess the current job duties of genetic counseling assistants (patient-related and non-patient related), to explore the genetic counselor view of GCA efficiency/effectiveness, and to assess GCA career goals (e.g., master’s in genetic counseling). 

All clinical genetic counselors and clinical genetic counseling assistants will be eligible to participate in this study.  If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete an online survey via Qualtrics that is a mix of multiple-choice and free-response questions followed by a brief demographic survey.  Completion of the survey should take no longer than 15 minutes. 

If you would like to participate in the survey, you can access it via this link:  https://mcwisc.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_08rpOL8RSd80kbI.

This study has been approved by the Bay Path University Institutional Review Board (IRB # 2021_Linn).  If you have any questions or concerns about the study, please do not hesitate to contact Sarah Linn at slinn2001@baypath.edu.

Thank you for helping to further research on genetic counseling assistant positions!

Best,

Sarah

"Hello all!  Young Women In Bio Seattle has put together a Genetic Counseling Career Panel and Q&A! We are featuring three practicing GCs and two GC grad students. This event will be a virtual Zoom Webinar on November 1st at 5:00 PM (PDT). 

We are gearing the event towards middle and high school students, but all individuals are welcome to attend! I would love it if anyone on the Discord could promote this event to any middle or high schools students in their lives. The goal for this event is to spread more awareness for Genetic Counseling as a career (don't know about you all but I definitely didn't know genetic counseling existed until I was in college). 

Again, anyone is welcome to attend (you don't need to be a middle or high school student), but the more students, the better.

From @Natasha Go (UCI) : Hello, my name is Natasha Go, I am a second year genetic counseling student from the UC Irvine program. I am currently recruiting participants for a research study investigating the type of, and opinions on, training that GC's receive/(d) regarding implicit bias and cultural sensitivity. This study may help inform future program developers how to better build and implement effective cultural sensitivity training for genetic counselors across the country.
You are eligible to participate in this study if you are:
•    18 years of age or older
•    Able to recall your experiences engaging in some type of cultural sensitivity training and implicit bias exercises through your training program.
•    A current genetic counseling trainee
OR
•    A recent graduate from the class of 2020 or 2021
The study will take place virtually via the Zoom communication platform. Your participation will entail a single focus-group session that is expected to last no longer than 1.5 hours. The focus group session will occur sometime in late fall – winter of 2021-2022. Exact time will be determined based on participant availability.
      As part of participating, you and three other genetic counseling trainees or recent graduates will be asked to have guided discussion about implicit bias and cultural sensitivity training you received at your respective training programs. The focus group discussion will be audio and video recorded. No identifiers will be utilized in analysis or publication. All names will be replaced with pseudonyms during transcription.

From @Deleted User : Hello everyone, the genetic counselors in the Neurology department at Boston Children’s Hospital are hosting a webinar next Thursday, 11/18 from 7 - 8 p.m. EST. The goal of the webinar is to provide further insight into the daily, dynamic life of a neurology genetic counselor for prospective genetic counseling students as well as currently enrolled genetic counseling students. We will be doing a brief overview of the “typical day in a life” of a GC here at Boston Children’s, and then diving right into case studies including how we handle non-diagnostic VUS cases, diagnostic cases, clinical trials, and some new gene therapy options. At the end, we will have a panel-style Q&A with our 8 genetic counselors, who specialize in working with patients with epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, brain malformations, neuromuscular disorders and more.
